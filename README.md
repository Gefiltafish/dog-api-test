This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

## Why I choose what:

### `Create React App`

Easy to set up and get started with.
I enjoy using react.
Can easily include Typescript.

### `Typescript`

Typing is great.
Altough it did not make it's fair share in here, typing the api-calls will help further production.

### `Styling the unnecessary logs in console`

Because it's fun.
